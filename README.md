## Abstract

_Rhodobacter sphaeroides_ 2.4.1 substrain H2 has the potential to produce environmentally friendly photoheterotrophic hydrogen gas from wastewater. We present two annotated hybrid genome assemblies for the mother strain DSM158 and its laboratory-derived substrain H2 based on Illumina short-reads and MinION long-reads. Both genomes consist of two chromosomes and four plasmids totalling in 4,520,357 bp with an estimated coverage of 1,490 and 4,520,324 bp with an estimated coverage of 805, respectively. BUSCO completeness is 98.2% for both assemblies, while the N50 values are 3,188,564 bp and 3,188,547 bp, respectively. CheckM completeness and contamination are 100% and 0.01%, respectively. The total number of genes/pseudogenes is 4,365/59 and 4,365/72, respectively. All of these metrics indicate the high quality and completeness of the assemblies presented in this study. Our results provide a solid foundation for further investigations of this substrain H2.
